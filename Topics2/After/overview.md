# After

## Overview
This directory contains information about events and developments that occurred after the Charlie Kirk incident.

## Goal
To analyze post-assassination events to prove the existence of a coordinated cover-up operation, including the quick "scrubbing" of the crime scene, Erika Kirk's refusal to allow an autopsy, the sealing of evidence until 2026, and the suppression of information about international aircraft involvement. This includes documenting how government agencies and media worked together to maintain the Tyler Robinson patsy narrative and hide evidence of the true assassins.
